# Marvel Character Introductions

This script scrapes data from [Marvel Wikia](http://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/Marvel_Database) on the number of characters introduced by Marvel per year since 1939, when Timely Comics was founded, and generates a graph and a statistics file.

Due to the recent *Inhumans vs. X-Men* comic book event, as well as the peculiarity of the Mutants vs. Inhumans rivalry due to the ownership of their rights for movies and TV, the amount of new characters for each of those categories was observed as well.

## Results and findings

- The maximum number of new characters (1861) was observed in 2009, when Disney bought Marvel;
- A few years after the creation of the Comics Code Authority in 1954, which caused a drop in the number of character debuts due to the new rules and regulations enforced on comic book publishers, Marvel had its smallest number of new characters ever (4);
- Big comic book events involving mutants, such as Age of Apocalypse and House of M, caused spikes on the number of new mutants introduced, which coincide with spikes on the overall number of new characters;
- There were more inhumans than mutants introduced in only three years: 1940, 1965 (year of the introduction of the inhumans) and 1966. As of today (February), 2017 is the fourth year ever where that happens.
